  <p>Thereyougo Website Application Phase Terms and Conditions</p>

  <p>1. Acceptance of Terms<br />
    By accessing or using the Thereyougo website pre-MVP ("Platform"), you agree to comply with and be bound by
    these
    Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Platform.
  </p>
  <p>2. Overview of Thereyougo<br />
    Thereyougo is a house, apartment, and room exchange platform catering to LinkedIn Professionals in the travel
    sector. The core business involves leveraging accommodations as assets for users to swap, enabling them to
    travel
    the world at $0/night. The Platform's competitive advantages include verified users, a robust security system,
    and a
    business model that allows users to transact with confidence.
  </p>
  <p>3. User Eligibility<br />
    During the Application period (December-February), LinkedIn Professionals are eligible to apply and get verified
    on
    the Platform.
  </p>
  <p> 4. Phase 1: User Attraction<br />
    4.1. User Verification: LinkedIn Professionals can apply and undergo verification during the 60-day Phase 1
    period.<br />
    4.2. Referral Incentive: Users can refer friends to register on the Platform.
    The user with the highest number of successfully referred friends will win a 1-week stay in a villa in Italy,
    with
    the option to bring up to 3 friends.
  </p>
  <p>5. User Responsibilities<br />
    Users are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of their accounts. Any unauthorised use
    of
    accounts must be reported immediately to Thereyougo.
  </p>
  <p>6. Swapping Functionality will be unavailable during Phase 1<br />
    6.1. Swapping Limitations: Throughout Phase 1 (December-February), the Thereyougo platform will not facilitate
    accommodation swaps.
    The swapping functionality will remain temporarily unavailable during this period.<br />
    6.2. Objective: The purpose of temporarily withholding swapping capabilities is to prioritise user attraction
    and
    the referral incentive program.
    This strategic approach ensures a substantial user base, enhancing the likelihood of successful accommodation
    matches in subsequent phases.<br />
    6.3. User Participation: Users are encouraged to actively engage in Phase 1 activities, such as verification and
    referrals, recognising that the full swapping features will be introduced in subsequent phases.<br />
    6.4. Advance Notice: Users will receive prior notification when the swapping functionality is set to be
    activated,
    signifying the transition from Phase 1 to the next stage of Thereyougo's operations.
  </p>
  <p>By utilizing the Platform during Phase 1, users acknowledge and accept the temporary limitation of swapping
    functionality as described in these Terms and Conditions.
